                When a friend told me he had read <b>Shoe Dog : A Memoir by the Creator of Nike</b> and that it was
                really good, I wasn't sure what to expect.
                I did not think my friend had poor taste, the book even had the little sticker that librarians put on
                ones that stand out &mdash; I just had trouble picturing how the autobiography of Nike's co-founder
                would
                really talk to me.
            </p>

            <p class="indent">
                Well I was wrong, I couldn't be more wrong and the book really deserved its little sticker from
                Renaud-Bray.
                It did not take a dozen pages for me to be absorbed in the story of Phil "Buck" Knight, a young Harvard
                graduate of 24 years old wanting to escape his home state Oregon and explore the world.

                We quickly discover during the first chapters his strong attachment to sport and more specifically
                running.
                This hobby is far from being unusual nowadays, but running in the sixties was definitely not seen as
                such.
                In fact, some people find it so weird that they were even calling the police
                on joggers

                Then follows the start of his adventure, importing Onitsuka Tiger (now known as ASICS) shoes from Japan
                to Oregon
                and selling them door to door on the West Coast.
                The revenue quickly grows, as well as the need to import more shoes every time.
                One thing that struck me while reading the book is how hard and unforgiving the whole operation looked
                like &mdash; and probably was (in a very similar manner as Pied Piper in Silicon Valley, running from
                one
                problem to a bigger one every year).
                The constant fights with the bank, the late shipments of merchandise and lack of communication from
                Onitsuka, the competitors that fought to obtain the exclusive rights to sell in the USA ; any of those
                had a non-negligeable chance of running this whole operation to the ground.
                However, their goal throughout the development of the company was simply not to fail, and they have
                avoided failure so well that I doubt many people ignore the brand today.

                One reason it has grown to be so iconic, in my opinion, is because it conveys not only goods, but the
                idea of a <i>lifestyle</i>.
                One might give the example of <b>Lululemon</b> for a similar brand, altough not as big (Nike's revenues
                were tenfold in 2021).
                You might think that I am being corny and it is nothing but a marketing technique, but it is hard while
                reading this story to feel untouched by their passion, if not obsession, to help runners.

                While on the topics of feelings, I was definitely surprised to be on the verge of crying a multiple
                times &mdash; so there is way more in this bible of capitalism and free market than just a story about
                selling
                shoes, trust me.
                His trip around the world, his love stories and how he met his wife, his complicated relationship with
                his sons, the tragic death of his friend, his bonds with the sportmen &mdash; it just feels so real, so
                close.

            <p class="indent">
                My only reproach to this book is the message to the reader which goes like this:
            </p>

            <div class="center margin-10">
                <cite>Follow your dreams, do great things.</cite>

                While he admits numerous times that he would love to start over, I couldn't help but be annoyed by this
                speech.
                The way he narrates book shows that he put everything after his company: his wife, kids, running (which
                is pretty ironic in his case) and wellbeing in general.
                This amount of sacrifices is maybe defensible for some, but certainly not for everyone and especially
                not me.
                Although his intent is probably to tell people to give their wildest dreams a chance, it is so easy to
                feel bad when reading this American success story and thinking you are not doing enough.
            </p>

            <p>
                To conclude, running is an amazing hobby and I want to thank him deeply for all he did to normalize and
                create the great culture around it present today.
