        My image processing class comes to an end, and with it I had to implement an algorithm of my choice.
        I chose the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (<b>SLIC</b>) Algorithm because the whitepaper looked really
        cool,
        and
        I'm quite glad I did because I had a lot of fun programming it.
        This algorithm is used to perform image segmentation, which is useful in many fields like medical imaging or
        computer vision for example.
        Furthermore, the segmentation is done using <i>superpixels</i>: geographically compact regions with similar
        colors.
        In fact, all operations are done in the LAB color space to benefit from its <i>perceptually uniform</i>
        property,
        really important to determine how <i>different</i> two colors are.
        This novel approach was particularly interesting when it came out in 2010 because it was both faster and easier
        to use than most contemporary State-of-the-Art approaches using superpixels.
        You will find below a few results I obtained after running the algorithm:

        algorithm in more detail, as well as giving more examples.
